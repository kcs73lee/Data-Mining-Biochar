# Exploring Nitrogen Retention in Soil: Data Mining and Predictive Modeling with Biochar Data

This project aims to investigate the characteristics of biochar in nitrogen retention using data mining methods and machine learning. Biochar is a form of charcoal produced from the pyrolysis of organic materials, such as wood, crop residues, or manure. It has been shown to be an effective way to improve soil fertility, but more research is needed to fully understand its potential.

Methods such as data processing along with imputation techniques such k-nearest neighbors, non-negative matrix factorization and Singular Value Decomposition will be used to understand the effects of nitrogen retention from various types of biochar. To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the imputation techniques, machine learning models such as adaboost and gradient boost for regression and classification are implemented. The results of this analysis could inform future policies and practices related to soil fertility.

By leveraging data mining methods, this project will shed light on the unique properties and characteristics of various biochar sources. It aims to identify more cost-effective biochar alternatives for improving soil fertility and potentially contribute to climate change mitigation efforts. The insights gained from this research can inform decision-making processes and promote sustainable agricultural practices.
